                <p>Clean your pet and all of its enclosures. This will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy. Create a regular cleaning schedule, at least once every 2-3 weeks, and stick to it, cleaning your animal and it's living spaces to prevent disease and odor. For larger pets like cats and dogs, there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses. days.
                    For dogs and cats, make sure you keep their nails short so they don't break painfully. [8]
                    It is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age. When brushing fur, ensure any brush used on the face is soft, and if brushing long, tangled fur, take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging. You can buy brushes for pets at pet stores.
                    When bathing your pet, make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction - buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary, but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals.</p> </div>

                <p>Often, in fact, we take it for granted that our fur might like it, but most of the time that's not the case.

                 This is why it is so important to get to know our feline friends better, and really understand their likes and dislikes. Only in this way will it be possible to create a calm and peaceful coexistence and at the same time a deeper and more positive bond for both.

                If we know how to notice them well, in fact, cats speak to us with their behavior, which we can learn to recognize and decode           <br> (to learn more about this topic, read also: “Cat behavior: leadership” ).

No matter how hard we try to create an enjoyable and peaceful home environment for our pet cats, at some point, most of them are exposed to stress in some form or another. Just as with people, how well our feline friends handle stress varies and depends on their inherent dispositions along with the nature of the stressor.</p>

This study evaluated changes in vital signs when dogs traveled between the home environment and the veterinary environment. Differences were recorded between dogs in the two environments1.

                These dogs had their respiratory rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature and systolic arterial blood pressure measured in their home                       environment. They were then taken to the veterinary hospital and the measurements were repeated. The changes between the two environments were significant1.

Sometimes, we even inadvertently encourage the behavior by making some of these objects into play toys, or, worse yet, giving dogs “toys” that closely resemble household items.</p>
